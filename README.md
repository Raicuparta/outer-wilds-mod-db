# Outer Wilds Mod Database

## How it works

Uses the mod list in `mods.json`, and for each mod it will fetch the required data. That data is then added to `releases.json`. This process is repeated every 15 minutes.

## Add your mod to the list

Fork this repo, add your mod to the end of the list in `mods.json`, and open a PR. The easiest way to do this is to [edit the file directly in GitHub.com](https://github.com/Raicuparta/outer-wilds-mod-db/edit/master/mods.json), and follow the big flashy buttons to fork the repo, and propose the change.
